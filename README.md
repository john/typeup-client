# README
This is the front end client, written in React, to the AWS Startup Kit TypeUp app, which can be configured to run with any of the TypeUp kit API demos. All of the demos define the same endpoints, so you can point this to any of them by changing config.js, and it should Just Workâ„¢.

### Installing locally
- Make sure you have node and npm installed. Here are links to guides for installing on [Mac OS](https://treehouse.github.io/installation-guides/mac/node-mac.html), [Windows](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/install-node-js-npm-windows), and [Linux](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/install-node-js-npm-linux) 
- Clone the repo into a local directory:
  - `git clone git@github.com:john/typeup-client.git`
  - `cd typeup-api-serverless`
- Install dependencies: `npm install`
- Run the app locally: `npm start`

### Configuration
- You need to get the base URL of your API Gateway and put it in config.js. Instructions for deploying the demo APIs can be found in their respective repos ([Serverless](https://github.com/john/typeup-api-serverless)), the README for each API has instructions for finding the API Gateway URL once deployed. In addition to the API Gateway, you'll need to [create a Cognito User Pool](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/create-new-user-pool-console-quickstart.html) for auth, and an S3 bucket for file uploads.

### Deploying remotely
- Package the app for production: `npm run build`
- Push to an S3 bucket: `aws s3 sync build/ s3://YOUR_S3_DEPLOY_BUCKET_NAME`
- [Configure your deployment S3 bucket as a static website](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/user-guide/static-website-hosting.html).
- *Optional*: configure a CloudFront distribution to speed up loading of your site.
- *Optional*: [Configure a custom domain](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/website-hosting-custom-domain-walkthrough.html) to point to either your S3 bucket or CloudFront distribution.

### TODO
- When you first sign up and Home.js loads, it's not getting users unless you reload
- API needs to verify auth before returning anything, if it's not already
- Disappear 'more' link when there isn't any more
- Add back blocked/unblocked

#### Features
- Groups
- SES




#### Code:
- How to get a list of all users in the pool?
- Do we need to have a 'Users' table in addition to the Cognito pool? Hope not.
