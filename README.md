# README
This project is based on the most excellent [Serverless Stack Tutorial](http://serverless-stack.com/)

This is the front end React client to all the TypeUp APIs demos. All of the demos define the same API, so you can point this to any of them by changing config.js, and it should work.

### Configuration
- You need to get the base URL of your API Gateway and put it in config.js

### TODO:

- When you first sign up and Home.js loads, it's not getting users.

#### Features:

- API needs to verify auth before returning anything, if it's not already


#### Code:
- How to get a list of all users in the pool?
- Do we need to have a 'Users' table in addition to the Cognito pool? Hope not.
